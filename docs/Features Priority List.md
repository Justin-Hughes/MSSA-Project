# Features Priority List

As a follow up to our correspondence last week, we wanted to reach out again and give a more distinct clarification on the priority of the features we outlined. In the following lists we will outline the three separate priority groupings we have determined. The first list will be the MVP list, or the Minimum Viable Product list. This list will include all of the features we feel are necessary for a bare minimum working product. The second list will be the Full list. This list will contain all of the features that we believe to be necessary to have a shippable product. The final list will be the Stretch list. This list, otherwise known as the "Dream Sheet" will have all of the features that we would like to have but may not be viable to implement given the current time constraints. If you have any questions or concerns about the placement of any of these features please reach out to us so that we may facilitate the creation process for this product.
