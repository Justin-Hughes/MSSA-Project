#Application Needs


	Hello, we here at Interactive Media Corporation are contacting you for the purpose of creating a game on our behalf.
We are looking at branching out from our normal operations into the gaming industry and require assistance in creating a solid
foundation for our library. The project doesn't have to be overly complex, just something that will bring enjoyment to our current
users and attract propsective customers. The following information describes the project as we have envisioned it, please feel free
to contact us with any questions you may have.

	The basis of the project is a simple 2D physics based tank game in which the players are pitted against each other 
and have to declare the velocity of the tanks shot in an attempt to hit the opponents tank. The basics of the game will be 
the ability of the tank to move around the map, multiple types of munnitions for the player to choose from, terrain destruction
from the attacks, local multiplayer, a stats tracking system with total shots fired, win/loss record, distance moved, etc., the
ability to create individual accounts to track these stats with, and the ability to customize the look of the tanks.

	Some of the more advanced features that we would like to see implemented would be the ability for the app to communicate
with a corresponding website to post to global leaderboards, the ability to connect to others in forums on said website, online 
multiplayer, computer opponents with adjustable difficulty levels, procedurally generated maps, user map creation tool, user weapon
creation tool, as well as connecting user social media accounts to the website.

	Please bare in mind that the target audience for this game library will be young adults, both male and female, between the
ages of 13 and 18. Because of this we do not want any unnecessary violence or flavorful language to be present in the game. The
timeline for this project is very short, so please keep in mind that we can push features to future updates as needed so that we
can ship the game with the library as close to its projected release date as possible. We thank-you for your time and look forward
to hearing back from you.
